# TiendaFrontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.1.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests locally with the Angular CLI (default):

```bash
ng test
```

To run the test suite with Vitest and generate a coverage report (CI-friendly):

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

The `test:ci` script runs Vitest with coverage and enforces the project coverage threshold (default 80%).

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-tests.yml`) that runs `npm run test:ci` on push and pull requests to `main` and uploads `coverage/lcov.info` as an artifact.

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
